# Nuxt Light Cycles - Complete Project Overview

A real-time multiplayer Tron-inspired light cycles game built with Nuxt 3, WebSockets, and XState state machines.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Light Cycles is a competitive grid-based game where players control light cycles that leave trails behind them. Players must avoid hitting walls, obstacles, and trails (including their own) while trying to outmaneuver opponents. The last player standing wins!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 (Vue 3 + TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Nuxt Server Routes with WebSocket support
- **State Management**: XState state machines for game and lobby logic
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket API
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for player settings

### Core Components

#### State Machines (XState)

**1. Lobby Machine** (`server/machines/lobby.machine.ts`)
- Manages lobby lifecycle: waiting ‚Üí starting ‚Üí inGame ‚Üí finished
- Handles player ready states
- Coordinates countdown timer before game start
- Tracks round numbers
- Events: PLAYER_JOIN, PLAYER_LEAVE, PLAYER_READY, START_COUNTDOWN, GAME_STARTED, GAME_ENDED, RETURN_TO_LOBBY

**2. Game Machine** (`server/machines/game.machine.ts`)
- Manages active gameplay: idle ‚Üí playing ‚Üí paused ‚Üí gameOver
- Handles game state transitions
- Events: START, PAUSE, RESUME, GAME_OVER

#### Server-Side Services

**Lobby Service** (`server/services/lobby.service.ts`)
- Creates and manages multiple lobby instances
- Each lobby has its own state machine actor
- Handles player management (join, leave, ready)
- Coordinates with game service for active games

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

### Development
- Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- WebSocket connects to same host automatically
- Hot module replacement enabled

## üéÆ How to Play

### Controls

**Desktop:**
- **Arrow Keys**: Change direction (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Shift**: Hold to activate speed brake (slower movement)

**Mobile:**
- **Virtual D-Pad**: Tap arrows to change direction (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- **Brake Button**: Tap and hold to activate speed brake

### Strategy Tips
1. **Plan ahead**: You can't reverse direction, only turn 90 degrees
2. **Use the brake**: Slow down in tight spaces
3. **Grab power-ups**: Speed boosts can help you escape tight situations
4. **Control the center**: More room to maneuver
5. **Cut off opponents**: Force them into walls or trails
6. **Watch for patterns**: AI has predictable behavior

## üé¨ Replay System

### Overview
The replay system records every player action and game event during gameplay, allowing you to watch games again with full playback controls. Replays are stored server-side and associated with your player ID.

### How It Works

**Recording**
- Automatically starts when a game begins
- Records player actions: movement inputs (up/down/left/right), braking
- Records game events: crashes, power-up spawns/collections, game start/end
- Captures initial game state: player positions, grid size, obstacles
- Minimal performance impact (< 1ms per tick)
- Stops recording when game ends

**Storage**
- Replays saved as JSON files in `server/api/replays/data/`
- User associations stored in `server/api/replays/users/`
- Each replay includes metadata: lobby name, date, duration, winner, player count
- Maximum 50 replays per user (oldest automatically deleted)

**Playback**
- Reconstructs game state from recorded actions tick-by-tick
- Simulates player movement, collisions, and power-ups
- Renders on canvas identical to live gameplay
- Independent of live game - purely client-side after loading

### Features

**Save Replay**
- "Save Replay" button appears after game ends (only for players, not spectators)
- One-click save with confirmation
- Automatically named with lobby name and timestamp

**Browse Replays**
- Access via "My Replays" button in lobby browser
- Grid view of all saved replays
- Sort by date (newest first)
- Shows metadata cards with:
  - Lobby name and grid size
  - Date and duration
  - Player count
  - Winner name and color (or "Draw")

**Watch Replay**
- Click "Watch" on any replay to open player
- Full-screen canvas playback
- Playback controls:
  - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play/Pause toggle
  - ‚èÆÔ∏è Restart from beginning
  - Timeline scrubber for seeking
  - Speed controls: 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x
- Player list showing all participants
- Winner highlighted with crown icon

**Delete Replay**
- Remove unwanted replays
- Instant deletion with confirmation
- Frees up space in your 50-replay limit

### Technical Details

**Replay Data Structure**
```typescript
{
  metadata: {
    replayId: string;
    userId: string;
    lobbyName: string;
    createdAt: number;
    duration: number;
    totalTicks: number;
    winner: { playerId, name, color } | null;
    playerCount: number;
    gridSize: number;
  },
  initialState: {
    gridSize: number;
    players: [...],
    obstacles: [...],
    settings: {...}
  },
  actions: [
    { tick, playerId, action: 'move'|'brake', payload, timestamp }
  ],
  events: [
    { tick, type: 'playerCrashed'|'powerUpSpawned'|..., payload, timestamp }
  ]
}
```

**Performance**
- Average replay file size: 50-200KB (5-10 minute game)
- Recording overhead: < 0.5ms per tick
- Playback is 100% deterministic
- No server load during playback (client-side only)

## üîß Configuration

### Game Settings (Customizable per lobby)
```typescript
interface GameSettings {
  gridSize: number;        // 30, 40, or 50
  maxPlayers: number;      // 2-4
  tickRate: number;        // 100ms (10 tps)
  maxPowerUps: number;     // 5
}
```

### Player Spawn Positions
- 2 players: Opposite corners (top-left, bottom-right)
- 3 players: Three corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left)
- 4 players: All four corners

### AI Configuration
- Decision interval: Every game tick
- Lookahead: 3 cells
- Avoidance priority: Walls > Trails > Obstacles
- Power-up attraction radius: 5 cells

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Audio**: No sound effects (yet!)

- [ ] Tournament bracket system
- [ ] Leaderboard and statistics
- [ ] More power-up types (shield, teleport, trail eraser)

- [ ] Chat system
- [ ] Friend system and private lobbies
- [ ] Customizable grid obstacles
- [ ] Team-based gameplay
- [ ] Replay sharing (export/import replay files)

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Server-side player input validation
- [ ] Anti-cheat measures
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large grids
- [ ] Database integration for persistent data
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## üìä Performance
